Phosphorylation at these sites has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to stimulate myosin II motor activity and in some cases to promote myosin II polymerization into bipolar thick filaments <xref rid="pone.0000131-Scholey1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0000131-KendrickJones1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The importance of Rok in regulating RLC phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic> has been demonstrated using a phospho-mimic RLC in which amino acids 20 and 21 have been changed to glutamates. Expression of RLCE20E21 can rescue larval lethality in Rok mutant flies <xref rid="pone.0000131-Winter1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In addition, phosphorylation of RLC in pupal wing cells is Rok-dependent <xref rid="pone.0000131-Winter1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, Rok controls the rate of furrow contraction, and its function is antagonized by a phosphatase specific for the RLC <xref rid="pone.0000131-Piekny1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Thus, clearly the RLC is an important target for Rok in regulating contractile events both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Rok activation may lead to RLC phosphorylation stimulating the myosin II motor to affect force production and cleavage during cytokinesis. However, we recently showed that both Rho1 and Rok are not only essential for cell cleavage, but also for the initial accumulation of myosin II at the cleavage furrow of <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells <xref rid="pone.0000131-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, suggesting that phosphorylation of the RLC may be involved in the recruitment of myosin II to the furrow. There is precedent for RLC phosphorylation affecting myosin II localization to the cell cortex. Royou et al. showed that expression of RLCE20E21 could restore myosin localization to the cortex of Rok-inhibited embryos during axial expansion <xref rid="pone.0000131-Royou1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and Chodagam, et al. reported that expression of RLC-E20E21 restores the cell-cycle dependent recruitment of myosin II to the cortex of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos in mutants of CP190, a protein that interacts with centrosomes during mitosis and binds to microtubules <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0000131-Chodagam1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, Jordan and Karess reported that non-phosphorylatable RLC is correctly localized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg chambers <xref rid="pone.0000131-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, suggesting that different cellular events involving myosin II may be regulated differently. Thus, we wanted to test specifically for the importance of RLC phosphorylation in the localization of myosin II to the equatorial cortex of cells during mitosis, where together with actin and other proteins it forms a cytokinetic ring. Furthermore, we wanted to assess the relative importance of Rok-induced phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain in myosin II localization and cytokinesis compared to the phosphorylation of other known Rok substrates, such as PTEN <xref rid="pone.0000131-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, Lim Kinase <xref rid="pone.0000131-Sumi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and ERM proteins <xref rid="pone.0000131-Fukata1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000131-Matsui1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. We show here that phosphorylation of the RLC is required for myosin II localization to the equatorial cortex during mitosis and that the essential role of Rok in myosin II localization and for cytokinesis is to maintain phosphorylation of the myosin RLC.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>RLC phosphorylation is required for myosin II recruitment to the cleavage furrow</title><p>While phospho-RLC has been detected in the cytokinetic furrows of mammalian cells <xref rid="pone.0000131-DeBiasio1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000131-Matsumura1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, to our knowledge its presence has not been verified in the furrows of dividing <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.

We therefore designed a wildtype construct RLCT20S21-GFP, a non-phosphorylatable construct RLCA20A21-GFP, and a phospho-mimic construct RLCE20E21-GFP in which 300 base pairs in the coding region of each RLC gene sequence were replaced with non-endogenous codons to allow for the specific depletion of the endogenous RLC using dsRNA designed against the endogenous codon sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000131.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Depletion of the endogenous RLC is necessary because of the filamentous nature of functional myosin II motors. In the presence of endogenous RLC, the mutant proteins will co-assemble with the endogenous RLCs onto myosin heavy chains resulting in myosin II filaments that contain a mixture of wildtype and mutant RLCs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows that RNAi was successful in depleting only the endogenous RLC and allowing for expression of the mutant-GFP chimeric proteins.

<bold>(A)</bold> Expression of mutant RLC constructs with alternative codons allows for depletion of only the endogenous RLC by RNAi. Cells expressing RLC-GFP constructs were treated with dsRNA that targets the endogenous sequence for 5 days.

S2 cells were treated with dsRNAs for 5 days to deplete the endogenous RLC and the fraction of approximately 100 cells that were binucleated (mean&#x000b1;SE) as measured by DAPI staining was calculated. The bar graphs show fraction of binucleate cells with and without treatment with RNAi against native RLC for wild type cells, cells expressing wildtype RLCT20S21-GFP, non-phosphorylatable RLCA20A21-GFP, and phospho-mimic RLCE20E21-GFP. <bold>(C)</bold> Phosphorylation of the RLC is essential for myosin II recruitment to the cleavage furrow. S2 cells expressing RLC-GFP chimeras (green) and RFP-&#x003b1;-tubulin (red) were depleted of the endogenous RLC by RNAi treatment for five days, and timelapse fluorescence microscopy was used to film cells as they attempted to divide. Both RLCT20S21-GFP (Row 1) and RLCE20E21-GFP (Row 3) were recruited to the equatorial cortex during mitosis and the cells contracted. However, RLCA20A21-GFP (Row 2) was not recruited to the equatorial cortex at anaphase and the cells did not contract.

Expression of the GFP-tagged wild type version of the regulatory light chain, RLCT20S21-GFP, in cells depleted of the endogenous RLC rescued the cytokinesis defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), and RLCT20S21-GFP was recruited normally to the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000131.s002">Movie S1</xref>). However, expression of the RLCA20A21-GFP non-phosphorylatable protein did not rescue the cytokinesis defect caused by depletion of the endogenous RLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This would be expected simply because activation of the myosin II motor domain by phosphorylation of the RLC is expected to be required for contraction of the furrow. Therefore, to test specifically for myosin II localization defects we used live-cell microscopy to film cells that express both the RLC-GFP constructs and mRFP-&#x003b1;-tubulin as the cells transitioned into anaphase and cytokinesis. Importantly, in the presence of the endogenous RLC, expression of RLCA20A21-GFP does not cause a cytokinesis defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and RLCA20A21-GFP is properly recruited to the equatorial cortex (data not shown). This demonstrates that the RLCA20A21-GFP is properly folded, associates with the myosin II heavy chain, and presumably is part of myosin bipolar thick filaments that contain both wild type and mutant forms of the RLC. Furthermore, this demonstrates that RLCA20A21-GFP does not cause a dominant negative effect on cytokinesis. After depletion of the endogenous RLC, however, RLCA20A21-GFP is not recruited to the equatorial cortex, and the cells do not elongate at anaphase nor contract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000131.s003">Movie S2</xref>), similar to cells depleted of myosin II heavy chain, Rho1, or Rok <xref rid="pone.0000131-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000131-Hickson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Approximately two-thirds of these cells filmed exhibited membrane ruffling during anaphase as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000131.s003">Movie S2</xref>. These data suggest that phosphorylation of the RLC is necessary for recruitment of myosin II to the cleavage furrow of dividing <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.</p><p>On the contrary, expression of the phospho-mimic RLCE20E21-GFP does not induce a cytokinesis defect upon depletion of the endogenous RLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, the phospho-mimic RLCE20E21-GFP is properly recruited to the equatorial cortex, and the cells furrow normally after depletion of the endogenous RLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000131.s004">Movie S3</xref>). Despite some variations in the example cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, examination of many cells of each type showed that the RLCT20S21-GFP expressing cells and the RLCE20E21-GFP expressing cells show no significant difference in the timing between anaphase onset and furrowing onset (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.15), the amount of time it takes to complete furrowing (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.10), nor the distribution of RLC-GFP during cytokinesis. However, the phospho-mimic RLCE20E21-GFP accumulates in the cortex during interphase and metaphase to a greater extent than the wildtype RLCT20S21-GFP (see, for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The only essential role of Rho Kinase in cytokinesis is the maintenance of RLC phosphorylation</title><p>In order to test whether Rok plays essential multifaceted roles in myosin II localization, we tested whether expression of phospho-mimic RLCE20E21-GFP could rescue Rok depletion. As a control, RLCT20S21-GFP expressing S2 cells showed a significant cytokinesis defect upon Rok depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and also showed a significant failure to localize the myosin to the equatorial cortex of the mitotic cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000131.s005">Movie S4</xref>). Expression of the phospho-mimic RLCE20E21-GFP, however, rescued the cytokinesis defect in Rok depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, cells depleted of Rok but expressing RLCE20E21-GFP recruited myosin II normally to the equatorial cortex during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000131.s006">Movie S5</xref>). Thus, despite its many potential targets, the sole essential role of Rok for myosin II localization is to maintain phosphorylation of the RLC. RLCE20E21-GFP was not able to rescue Rho1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000131-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with data showing that Rho1 activates multiple proteins essential for cytokinesis besides Rok, including Diaphanous <xref rid="pone.0000131-Watanabe1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and Citron <xref rid="pone.0000131-Madaule1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0000131-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000131.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>The only essential role of Rok during cytokinesis is to maintain phosphorylation of myosin II RLC.</title><p>

The increase in antibody staining in Citron depleted cells as compared to normal cells suggests that Citron depletion results in a structural change in late furrows that allows for antibodies to bind that are somewhat excluded from normal furrows. Thus, Citron may be important for maintaining the structural integrity of the late midbody.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that myosin II RLC localized at the cleavage furrow is phosphorylated and that this phosphorylation is required for the proper recruitment of myosin II to the equatorial cortex. While such a role was suggested by earlier studies showing that Rok is essential for myosin II localization to the equatorial cortex of dividing <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells <xref rid="pone.0000131-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, this is the first direct demonstration that the RLC phosphorylation state regulates proper recruitment of myosin II to the equatorial cortex.</p><p>Cells expressing a phospho-mimic RLC did not show a cytokinesis defect. Thus, dephosphorylation of the RLC at late telophase must not be required to complete cytokinesis. In addition, localized regulation of RLC phosphorylation at the furrow must not be necessary for myosin II recruitment. Instead, pre-&#x0201c;phosphorylated&#x0201d; myosin II can be recruited to the furrow. Thus, the widely-held view that myosin II accumulates at the equatorial cortex because of cortical flow is most likely incorrect. According to the cortical flow model, localized activation of the myosin II motor at the equatorial cortex induces tension there such that the contents of the cortex flow toward the center of the cell resulting in the accumulation of cleavage furrow proteins. However, phospho-mimic RLC should be equally active throughout the cortex, and yet it accumulates at the equator. Also arguing against the cortical flow model is our observation that F-actin is not required for myosin II recruitment <xref rid="pone.0000131-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, we have shown that the essential role of Rok in cytokinesis is simply to maintain phosphorylation of myosin II RLC, as shown by the rescue of all Rok depletion cytokinesis phenotypes by expression of phospho-mimic RLC. This is especially interesting because Rok has also been shown to phosphorylate the lipid phosphatase PTEN <xref rid="pone.0000131-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> which plays a role in cytokinesis in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0000131-Janetopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and Lim kinase which phosphorylates Cofilin <xref rid="pone.0000131-Maekawa1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, an essential cytokinesis protein <xref rid="pone.0000131-Gunsalus1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Rok can contribute to myosin II RLC phosphorylation in two ways: through the phosphorylation of the RLC and by suppressing the activity of the myosin phosphatase by phosphorylation of its subunit Mbs <xref rid="pone.0000131-Kawano1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Our results are consistent with Rok being involved in either role. However, Hickson et al. have shown that Rok is important for triggering the onset of furrowing even in the absence of Mbs <xref rid="pone.0000131-Hickson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In addition, depletion of any other known myosin light chain kinase in combination with Rok and Mbs depletion does not induce a furrowing defect <xref rid="pone.0000131-Hickson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Therefore, it is likely that Rok is involved in myosin localization during mitosis by directly phosphorylating the RLC.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that Citron Kinase is neither required for RLC phosphorylation during cytokinesis nor can phospho-mimic RLC rescue the cytokinesis defect induced by Citron depletion. Instead our results suggest that Citron may be important for maintaining the structural integrity of the late midbody. A role for Citron in maintaining the structure of late furrows is consistent with the phenotype of Citron mutants in which the membrane of late furrows blebs dramatically <xref rid="pone.0000131-DAvino1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0000131-Somma1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Previously, phosphorylation of the RLC has been hypothesized to be important for this role by regulating the interaction of the RLC with anillin, a protein that binds F-actin, membranes, and phospho-RLC myosin II <xref rid="pone.0000131-DAvino1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. However, because phospho-mimic RLC cannot rescue Citron depletion, the role of Citron in late furrows is not likely to be RLC phosphorylation.</p><p>This study clearly demonstrates a role for RLC phosphorylation in regulating myosin II localization in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Further studies should help elucidate the molecular mechanism by which cells differentiate between phospho- and non-phospho-RLC myosin II and specifically recruit the former to the equatorial cortex of a cell in mitosis. While phospho-RLC myosin II has a higher motor activity, this activity is not likely to be involved in regulating myosin II recruitment to the furrow because F-actin is not required for this recruitment <xref rid="pone.0000131-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Interestingly, bipolar thick filament formation of some myosin IIs is regulated by RLC phosphorylation, and studies in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> have clearly demonstrated that formation of bipolar thick filaments is required for myosin II localization to the furrow in that system <xref rid="pone.0000131-Sabry1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Intriguingly, phospho-mimic RLC- containing myosin II appears to be over-accumulated in the cortex of interphase and metaphase cells in a similar manner to <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> myosin II that is constitutively assembled into thick filaments <xref rid="pone.0000131-Sabry1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000131-Egelhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Further studies will be needed to show whether thick filament formation plays a role in myosin II localization in cells of higher eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid Construction and Cell Culture</title><p>Plasmids for expression of RLC-GFP constructs were created as follows: Plasmid pCasper-sqh-sqh-gfp <xref rid="pone.0000131-Royou2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> was digested with SpeI and NotI restriction enzymes to release a fragment of the RLC gene (called <italic>sqh</italic>) encoding the phosphorylation sites.
