While the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> and &#x003b3;<sup>G</sup> genes are expressed in fetal liver, both are silenced in adult erythrocytes. In order to decipher the role of DNA methylation in this process, we generated a YAC transgenic mouse system that allowed us to control &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> methylation during development. DNA methylation causes a 20-fold repression of &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> both in non-erythroid and adult erythroid cells. In erythroid cells this modification works as a dominant mechanism to repress &#x003b3; gene expression, probably through changes in histone acetylation that prevent the binding of erythroid transcription factors to the promoter. These studies demonstrate that DNA methylation serves as an elegant in vivo fine-tuning device for selecting appropriate genes in the globin locus. In addition, our findings provide a mechanism for understanding the high levels of &#x003b3;-globin transcription seen in patients with Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin, and help explain why 5azaC and butyrate compounds stimulate &#x003b3;-globin expression in patients with &#x003b2;-hemoglobinopathies.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome wide DNA methylation is set up during early development and then maintained in a semi-conservative manner through every cell division <xref rid="pone.0000046-Brandeis1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The presence of methyl groups apparently serves as a molecular signal that can direct the packaging of DNA into a closed inaccessible chromatin conformation <xref rid="pone.0000046-Keshet1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and bring about the local deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 <xref rid="pone.0000046-Hashimshony1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Because of these observations, it has been postulated that methylation may serve as a global mechanism for repression of basal transcription <xref rid="pone.0000046-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In keeping with this organization, many tissue specific genes are found methylated in almost all cell types of the organism, but undergo developmentally regulated demethylation in their cell type of expression <xref rid="pone.0000046-Yeivin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Little is known about the role of DNA methylation in this differentiation process.</p><p>A good system for studying gene specific methylation is the human &#x003b2;-globin locus on chromosome 11 which is composed of five different &#x003b2;-type genes that are expressed in a regulated manner during development <xref rid="pone.0000046-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In non-erythroid cells, the entire locus replicates late in S phase <xref rid="pone.0000046-Dhar1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0000046-Epner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and is packaged into a closed DNaseI-insensitive chromatin conformation, where all of the individual genes are methylated. In contrast, during erythroid cell specific differentiation, the full locus undergoes an &#x0201c;opening&#x0201d; process, becoming early replicating and generally DNaseI sensitive <xref rid="pone.0000046-Forrester1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, but only specific genes undergo demethylation and actually become transcriptionally active. Thus, for example, &#x003b3;-globin genes are preferentially active in the fetal liver, while mainly the &#x003b2; gene is active in adult erythroid cells where both &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> and &#x003b3;<sup>G</sup> remain methylated <xref rid="pone.0000046-vanderPloeg1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and silenced in a process that appears to be mediated by MBD2 <xref rid="pone.0000046-Rupon1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Using a genetic approach in transgenic mice we demonstrate that DNA methylation plays a local role in preventing the activation of &#x003b3; globin in adult erythroid cells, and this effect is mediated by histone deacetylation and the prevention of factor binding. These findings provide a strong experimental basis for approaches aimed at inducing &#x003b3; expression in cases of &#x003b2;-Thalassemia through treatments that bring about DNA demethylation or histone acetylation. Our results also suggest that demethylation may be an obligatory step in the molecular mechanisms that bring about the abnormal expression of &#x003b3; globin seen in Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experimental strategy</title><p>In order to determine the precise role of DNA methylation in the repression of &#x003b3;-globin gene expression, we devised a biological approach for controlling local methylation. For this purpose we used a (Yeast Artificial Chromosome) YAC transgene carrying the entire human &#x003b2;-globin locus that has been shown to be properly regulated in the mouse <xref rid="pone.0000046-Peterson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000046-Gaensler1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. During early development, at the time of implantation, CpG island regions are recognized and protected from the process of de novo methylation <xref rid="pone.0000046-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This is accomplished through the involvement of cis acting sequences <xref rid="pone.0000046-Brandeis2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000046-Macleod1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and one such element (IE&#x02014;Island Element) identified in the Aprt locus, has been shown to work dominantly to prevent methylation of transgenes in vivo <xref rid="pone.0000046-Hashimshony1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Preliminary experiments indicated that the insertion of two tandem copies of the IE near the &#x003b3;-globin promoter could generate a relatively large (1 kb) unmethylated region that was then maintained in all somatic cells of the mouse (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). On the basis of this observation we engineered a duplicated IE sequence flanked with LoxP sites 40 bp upstream to the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> -globin gene transcription start site in a 150 kb YAC which carries the entire human &#x003b2;-globin locus <xref rid="pone.0000046-Tanimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and this construct was used to generate transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000046-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Four founder animals with intact YACs were obtained, and Southern blot analysis showed that 3 of them (47, 64, 113) were completely unmethylated at one selective restriction site in the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> gene promoter, indicating that this strategy was successful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000046-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

The first line of cre mice (Cre) contain an expression vector which is constitutively active in all cell types from very early stages in development <xref rid="pone.0000046-Lallemand1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In F1 animals generated from this cross, the IE would be removed prior to implantation and, as a result, the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> gene becomes methylated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000046-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The Mx-Cre mouse, in contrast, contains an interferon-inducible cre gene <xref rid="pone.0000046-Kuhn1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In F1 animals from this cross, the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> gene should be protected from de novo methylation at the time of implantation. In the adult, the IE can be removed by treatment with interferon, but the gene should still remain unmodified. Thus, using this strategy, it should be possible to generate matched transgenic mice with a fixed integration site whose only difference is the DNA methylation state at the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> promoter throughout the organism <xref rid="pone.0000046-Siegfried1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Effect of DNA methylation on gene expression</title><p>Using the globin YAC transgene, it was now possible to determine the effect of DNA methylation on transcription of the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> gene in both non-erythroid and erythroid cells. As non-erythroid cells, we used mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEFs) generated from Cre or Mx-Cre transgenic (line 64) crosses. The bisulfite sequencing technique was used to measure the methylation state at the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> and &#x003b3;<sup>G</sup> promoters. In cells in which the IE was removed pre-implantation (Cre), the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> gene was found to be completely methylated at 4 upstream CpG sites. In contrast, cells that retained the IE during implantation (Mx-Cre) were highly unmethylated in this same region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000046-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The &#x003b3;<sup>G</sup> promoter provided an important control that remained methylated in all MEFs from transgenic mice.</p><p>Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the level of expression of the &#x003b3; as well as &#x003b2;-globin genes. We took advantage of a unique restriction enzyme site within the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> gene to distinguish between &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> and &#x003b3;<sup>G</sup> transcripts. We found that the unmethylated &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> gene is transcribed at much higher levels (about 20 fold) than the methylated copy, while both the &#x003b3;<sup>G</sup> and &#x003b2;-globin genes are expressed at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000046-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These results are consistent with previous studies showing that DNA methylation of &#x003b3; gene promoters inhibits transcription in transfected fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0000046-Busslinger1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. It should be noted that these steady state levels of RNA in MEFs are about 8&#x02013;9 orders of magnitude less than that in fetal liver or adult erythroblasts. Most of this inhibition is clearly independent of DNA methylation.</p><fig id="pone-0000046-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000046.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Effect of DNA methylation on gene expression</title><p>A.

In these cells, the &#x003b2;-globin gene is expressed at very high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000046-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). While the &#x003b3;-globin sequences are transcribed at a low level compared to &#x003b2;-globin, this is still about 6 orders of magnitude higher than that measured in non erythroid cells. This increased expression is presumably due to the fact that this locus is in a more open overall chromatin conformation in these cells. It should be noted, however, that this amount of &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup>-globin RNA is still considerably lower than the levels produced in fetal liver. Undermethylation of the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> gene promoter in spleen erythroblasts brings about a striking 20-fold average increase in the activity of this gene as compared to its methylated counterpart in three independent transgenic founders. In contrast, the constitutively methylated &#x003b3;<sup>G</sup> promoter remained repressed, and this serves as an internal negative control for the induction seen with &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup>.</p><p>Although the normal percentage of &#x003b3; globin expression in human erythroblasts is about 5&#x02013;10&#x00025; of the total (&#x003b3;&#x0002b;&#x003b2;) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genecards.org/index.shtml">http://www.genecards.org/index.shtml</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://symatlas.gnf.org/SymAtlas">http://symatlas.gnf.org/SymAtlas</ext-link>), this ratio appears much lower (1&#x00025;) in our mice, and this is, in fact, consistent with previous data from other transgenic animals carrying similar constructs (0.3&#x02013;3&#x00025;) <xref rid="pone.0000046-Gaensler1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000046-Peterson2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In the absence of DNA methylation on the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> promoter, &#x003b3; globin expression ratio increases (to a level of 3&#x02013;6&#x00025;), but if we assume that the &#x003b3;<sup>G</sup> gene is affected by demethylation to the same extent, total &#x003b3;/&#x003b3;&#x0002b;&#x003b2; would actually be expected to reach levels of 10&#x02013;25&#x00025;, which is approximately the same order of magnitude as that seen in fetal liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000046-g002">Figure 2</xref> and or cases of transgenic HPFH (30&#x02013;65&#x00025;)where both the &#x003b3; and &#x003b2; genes are active <xref rid="pone.0000046-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. It thus appears that DNA methylation is serving as a local mechanism to repress the activity of &#x003b3;-globin genes in adult erythroid cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Effect of DNA methylation on histone modification</title><p>One of the mechanisms by which DNA methylation inhibits gene expression is by bringing about the deacetylation of local histones <xref rid="pone.0000046-Hashimshony1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. We therefore examined the histone modification pattern of nucleosomes positioned in the promoter region of the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> and &#x003b3;<sup>G</sup> genes in vivo. This was carried out by isolating mononucleosomes from fibroblast or erythroblast cells and subjecting them to Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis using antibodies against Ac-H4. The active mouse &#x003b2;-actin and inactive &#x003b1; actin genes were used as matched controls for verifying the efficacy of immunoprecipitation.</p><p>As expected, the methylated &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> gene promoter in non-erythroid cells is packaged in nucleosomes containing deacetylated histone H4, in a manner similar to other repressed genes. Strikingly, in the absence of DNA methylation, this region becomes acetylated, reaching the same maximum levels probably as a result of methyl binding proteins <xref rid="pone.0000046-Rupon1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> associated with transcriptionally active genes such as &#x003b2;-actin or &#x003b2;-globin in erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000046-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Identical findings were observed for methylation of H3(K4) (data not shown), which is also known to be correlated with gene activity. This change in the histone modification pattern is surprising in light of the fact that &#x003b3;-globin is expressed at such low levels in non-erythroid cells, suggesting that as opposed to other repression mechanisms, it is DNA methylation that plays a dominant role in setting up or maintaining histone acetylation at this locus.</p><fig id="pone-0000046-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000046.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Effect of DNA methylation on promoter structure</title><p>Mononucleosomes were prepared from either non-erythroid (<bold>A</bold>) or erythroid (<bold>B</bold>) cells taken from Cre (methylated) and Mx-cre (unmethylated) founder (64) transgene crosses and subjected to ChIP analysis using anti-Ac-H4.</p><p>Input (I) and bound (B) DNA fractions were used for semi-quantitative PCR on 1 or 3 &#x000b5;l samples using primer sets specific for the &#x003b3;<sup>G</sup> or loxP-inserted &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> promoter regions.</p><p>For each ChIP preparation, the Acta1 gene (green) was assayed as a negative control and the Actb gene (yellow) as a positive control.</p><p>The results are summarized in graphic form after normalizing to Acta1 (green) enrichment (set at 1.0) (coefficient of variance&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;17&#x00025;).</p><p>The results for the Cre (blue) and Mx-cre (red) mice are shown.</p><p>Results for &#x003b2; globin are presented for comparison.</p><p>The data shown for non-erythroid cells was obtained using mononucleosomes from MEFs, but the graph summarizes results from 3&#x02013;4 ChIP experiments on both MEFs and lymphocytes.</p><p>(<bold>C</bold>) In vivo footprinting of &#x003b3; promoter.</p><p>Erythroblasts (in vivo) or purified erythroblast DNA (in vitro) from mice carrying either a methylated or unmethylated &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> promoter were treated with DMS.

In these cells, the &#x003b3; genes are expressed at levels 6 orders of magnitude greater than that seen in fibroblasts. Despite this, both the &#x003b3;<sup>G</sup> and &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> promoters are packaged with nucleosomes containing deacetylated histone H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000046-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This is most likely due to the presence of DNA methylation, since removal of these methyl moieties brings about a dramatic increase in both the acetylation of H4 and methylation of H3(K4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000046-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and data not shown). This suggests that in erythroid cells, it is basically DNA methylation which keeps the &#x003b3; genes packaged in their deacetylated form, and this probably accounts for their suboptimal level of expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Effect of DNA methylation on protein binding</title><p>One of the major effectors of globin expression in erythroid cells is the presence of highly specific transcription factors such as GATA1, CP1/NF-Y and NFE3 that recognize defined sequence motifs present at many sites within the globin locus, including the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> promoter <xref rid="pone.0000046-Duan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0000046-Ronchi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In order to test whether DNA methylation plays a role in these interactions, we carried out in vivo footprint analysis in both adult erythroid cells and lymphocytes derived from the spleen. As expected, no significant footprints were observed in the lymphoid cells (data not shown). Similarly, footprints were also absent in normal adult erythroid cells in which the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> promoter is methylated. In contrast, when these methyl groups are absent, strong footprints over both the GATA-1 and distal CP1/NF-Y (CCAAT box) binding sites were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000046-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). It should be noted that these elements themselves do not contain any CpG sites, so it is unlikely that binding is inhibited directly by methyl groups. Rather, it appears that these specific protein-DNA interactions are prevented at the nucleosome level by local methylation-mediated histone deacetylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>DNA methylation in HPFH</title><p>In patients with Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin (HPFH) the &#x003b3; genes are expressed at unusually high levels in adult erythroid cells <xref rid="pone.0000046-Forget1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Our results on the role of DNA methylation at this locus strongly suggest that whatever the molecular mechanism at the source of this disease, activation of the &#x003b3;-globin genes should only be possible if the promoter is demethylated. In order to test this hypothesis, we prepared erythroblast cultures <xref rid="pone.0000046-Fibach1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> from HPFH patients with different genetic lesions, and then isolated DNA for bisulfite analysis of the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> and &#x003b3;<sup>G</sup> genes.

In further support of this, we find that DNA methylation actually affects protein binding specifically at the exact same sites in the &#x003b3; promoter that are frequently involved in HPFH <xref rid="pone.0000046-Ronchi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In non-erythroid cells, the entire globin locus is associated with heterochromatin <xref rid="pone.0000046-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000046-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and packaged in a closed chromatin conformation characterized by a lack of sensitivity to DNaseI <xref rid="pone.0000046-Forrester1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and late replication timing <xref rid="pone.0000046-Simon1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, the &#x003b3; promoters carry methyl groups that were initially put on at the time of implantation and then maintained through subsequent cell divisions. These mechanisms apparently serve to make the locus compact and highly inaccessible to nuclear proteins such as RNA polymerase and its accompanying basal transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000046-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). For this reason, synthesis from the &#x003b3; promoters initiates very infrequently. By genetically preventing normal developmentally-regulated DNA methylation at this site, we were able to selectively remove a single layer of protection, thus allowing the transcription machinery to increase initiation of RNA synthesis at the promoter by about 20 fold. We have previously demonstrated that this is accomplished through methyl binding proteins that locally recruit histone deacetylase <xref rid="pone.0000046-Hashimshony1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Our results strongly suggest that in the absence of methylation, the auxiliary repression layers, which evidently operate through very different mechanisms, are not able to bring about local histone deacetylation.</p><p>Previous studies had shown that the human globin locus is programmed to be turned on regionally in erythroid cells generated at different stages of development. This is mediated by an increase in chromatin accessibility (DNaseI sensitivity) over the entire locus <xref rid="pone.0000046-Forrester1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, as well as a shift to early replication timing <xref rid="pone.0000046-Goren1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, an epigenetic change that also influences chromatin structure <xref rid="pone.0000046-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. As part of the normal process of adult erythroid differentiation, the &#x003b2;-globin gene undergoes local demethylation <xref rid="pone.0000046-vanderPloeg1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and this probably represents the last stage necessary to allow the binding of erythroid trans acting transcription factors.</p><p>Although the &#x003b3;-globin genes do not undergo demethylation in adult erythroid cells and are still packaged with deacetylated histones, chromatin changes in cis make these genes about 10<sup>6</sup> fold more likely to be transcribed, but this is still not sufficient to allow the synthesis of &#x003b3;-globin at maximum levels. By manipulating the locus so that the &#x003b3;<sup>A</sup> gene is unmethylated, however, the last repression barrier is removed and this gene can then interact with the strong transcription factors already present in erythroid cells, thereby allowing near maximal levels of RNA synthesis. Interestingly, these factors fail to react with similar &#x003b2; globin promoter elements in fetal erythroid cells <xref rid="pone.0000046-Ikuta1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, strongly suggesting that this may also be due to DNA methylation. Thus, in addition to being a basal repression mechanism in non-erythroid cells, DNA methylation also works as a selective regulator in erythroid cells. Since DNA methylation plays a similar role in the immune system <xref rid="pone.0000046-Ji1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, it is possible that this represents a general fine-tuning mechanism for controlling expression within gene clusters.</p><p>Several studies have shown that the symptoms in &#x003b2;-Thalassemia can be partly alleviated by treatment with DNA demethylation <xref rid="pone.0000046-Ley1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> or histone acetylation agents <xref rid="pone.0000046-Perrine1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, presumably by bringing about increased synthesis of &#x003b3;-globin.
