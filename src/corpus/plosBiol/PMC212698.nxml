<article-title>Large-Scale Association Study Confirms Genetic Complexity Underlying Type 2 Diabetes</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Type 2 diabetes is an increasingly common, serious metabolic disorder with a substantial inherited component. It is characterised by defects in both insulin secretion and action. Progress in identification of specific genetic variants predisposing to the disease has been limited. To complement ongoing positional cloning efforts, we have undertaken a large-scale candidate gene association study. We examined 152 SNPs in 71 candidate genes for association with diabetes status and related phenotypes in 2,134 Caucasians in a case-control study and an independent quantitative trait (QT) cohort in the United Kingdom. Polymorphisms in five of 15 genes (33%) encoding molecules known to primarily influence pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function&#x02014;<italic>ABCC8</italic> (sulphonylurea receptor), <italic>KCNJ11</italic> (KIR6.2), <italic>SLC2A2</italic> (GLUT2), <italic>HNF4A</italic> (HNF4&#x003b1;), and <italic>INS</italic> (insulin)&#x02014;significantly altered disease risk, and in three genes, the risk allele, haplotype, or both had a biologically consistent effect on a relevant physiological trait in the QT study. We examined 35 genes predicted to have their major influence on insulin action, and three (9%)&#x02014;<italic>INSR</italic>, <italic>PIK3R1</italic>, and <italic>SOS1</italic>&#x02014;showed significant associations with diabetes. These results confirm the genetic complexity of Type 2 diabetes and provide evidence that common variants in genes influencing pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function may make a significant contribution to the inherited component of this disease. This study additionally demonstrates that the systematic examination of panels of biological candidate genes in large, well-characterised populations can be an effective complement to positional cloning approaches. The absence of large single-gene effects and the detection of multiple small effects accentuate the need for the study of larger populations in order to reliably identify the size of effect we now expect for complex diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The absence of large single gene effects and the detection of multiple small effects confirms the genetic complexity of type 2 diabetes and the need for even larger studies</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Type 2 diabetes is a serious metabolic disease associated with an increased risk of premature death and substantial disability, largely mediated through its adverse effects on the vasculature. The prevalence of the disease is increasing, and the World Health Organisation estimates suggest that by 2025 there will be 300 million affected individuals worldwide (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-King1" ref-type="bibr">King et al. 1998</xref>). The disorder is characterised by a combination of impaired insulin secretion and insulin action, both of which precede and predict the onset of disease (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Weyer1" ref-type="bibr">Weyer et al. 1999</xref>). Through its adverse impact on insulin action, obesity is a major risk factor for the disease. Although environmental factors, both post- and prenatal, play an important role in determining the risk of disease, a substantial body of evidence supports the notion that disease susceptibility is influenced by inherited factors (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Zimmet1" ref-type="bibr">Zimmet 1982</xref>). While the molecular basis for several uncommon Mendelian forms of Type 2 diabetes have been defined (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Vionnet1" ref-type="bibr">Vionnet et al. 1992</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Yamagata1" ref-type="bibr">Yamagata et al. 1996a</xref>, <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Yamagata2" ref-type="bibr">1996b</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Horikawa1" ref-type="bibr">Horikawa et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Stoffers1" ref-type="bibr">Stoffers et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Barroso1" ref-type="bibr">Barroso et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Malecki2" ref-type="bibr">Malecki et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Savage1" ref-type="bibr">Savage et al. 2002</xref>), the nature and range of allelic variants conferring susceptibility to the more common forms of this disorder remain poorly defined. Many investigators have embarked on attempts to identify diabetes susceptibility genes through genome-wide linkage-based approaches using multigenerational pedigrees and/or large numbers of affected sibpairs. Regions of significant linkage, some of which have been replicated in more than one study, have been identified. To date, however, only Calpain 10 (<italic>CAPN10</italic>; LocusLink ID 11132) has emerged from such studies as a new putative diabetogene (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Horikawa2" ref-type="bibr">Horikawa et al. 2000</xref>). While some subsequent studies have supported a role for the <italic>CAPN10</italic> alleles originally described as susceptibility alleles, others have found associations with different alleles and some have found no association with this gene (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Baier2" ref-type="bibr">Baier et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">Cox 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">Evans et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Hegele2" ref-type="bibr">Hegele et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Daimon1" ref-type="bibr">Daimon et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Elbein1" ref-type="bibr">Elbein et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Garant1" ref-type="bibr">Garant et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>The positional cloning effort has been supplemented by a large number of studies examining specific candidate genes using a variety of methodologies, mostly of the case-control association design. Although many positive reports have emerged, few have been consistently replicated. Of these candidates, the most compelling evidence to date, generated from a meta-analysis of multiple published studies, is that a common amino acid variant in the N-terminus of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; (<italic>PPARG</italic>; LocusLink ID 5468) confers significant protection against the development of Type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Altshuler1" ref-type="bibr">Altshuler et al. 2000</xref>). More recently, evidence has accumulated supporting a role for the E23K variant of <italic>KCNJ11</italic> (LocusLink ID 3767) in Type 2 diabetes predisposition (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Hani1" ref-type="bibr">Hani et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Gloyn1" ref-type="bibr">Gloyn et al. 2001</xref>, <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Gloyn2" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Love-Gregory1" ref-type="bibr">Love-Gregory et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>Whole-genome association studies in large case-control populations may ultimately have the greatest power to detect alleles of small but significant effects on the susceptibility to common diseases such as Type 2 diabetes. As yet, however, the resource implications of such an approach are prohibitive. In the meantime, knowledge of both mammalian biology and disease pathogenesis is progressing rapidly, and it is possible to identify a large panel of known genes, the dysfunction of which might reasonably be considered likely to contribute to Type 2 diabetes. In this study we have identified 152 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 71 such genes and, using these, have examined their association with Type 2 diabetes and related intermediate phenotypes in Caucasian subjects from the United Kingdom.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overall Study Design</title><p>Candidate gene studies are based on selection of genes with a known or inferred biological function whose role makes it plausible that they may predispose to disease or the observed phenotype. These types of studies are similar to traditional epidemiological approaches in which an a priori hypothesis between exposure to a given factor (in this case, a genotype at a given locus) and disease is formulated. To date, most Type 2 diabetes candidate gene studies have largely lacked thoroughness and sensitivity, as they have tested a limited number of genes and variants in small populations or in populations that were poorly matched or phenotyped, frequently resulting in a lack of replication of the weak associations detected (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Altshuler1" ref-type="bibr">Altshuler et al. 2000</xref>). Our strategy aimed to address these problems by a unique combination of features, including comprehensive SNP discovery in a large number of candidate genes, testing of a large number of SNPs, use of two independent populations, and analysis of haplotypes in addition to individual SNPs where possible.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0000020-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the overall design of the study. On the basis of their known or putative role in glucose metabolism, 71 candidate genes were selected for study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0000020-t101">Table 1</xref>). These were subdivided into three broad groups: (1) genes primarily involved in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function; (2) genes primarily influencing insulin action and glucose metabolism in the main target tissues, muscle, liver, and fat; and (3) other genes. This group includes genes that influence processes potentially relevant to diabetes, such as energy intake, energy expenditure, and lipid metabolism. A de novo search for common SNPs was undertaken using fluorescent single-stranded conformation polymorphism (fSSCP) examination of all coding regions and splice junctions in a variety of human populations. All genes were minimally screened against 47 samples of mixed ethnicity, providing 0.99 probability of detecting variants with a minor allele frequency of 0.05. Our &#x02018;in-house' polymorphism detection programme identified 954 SNPs in the 71 genes, with a range of allele frequencies from 0.003 to 0.50. Of the 152 SNPs chosen for further study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>), the great majority had a minor allele frequency of greater than 5%, but in a few instances less frequent variants were typed when the candidate gene had strong biological plausibility and there were no known polymorphisms of higher frequency at the time of SNP selection.</p><fig id="pbio-0000020-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study Design</title><p>Candidate genes were selected based on known or putative function.

A second independent population was also genotyped for the same 152 SNPs. This consisted of 1,100 middle-aged Caucasian subjects in the United Kingdom who had been extensively and serially phenotyped for glucose tolerance and variables related to insulin secretion, insulin action, and adiposity. In the first stage of data analysis, all SNPs (and haplotypes when multiple SNPs were present at the same gene) were examined for their association with diabetes in the case-control study using multiple models of inheritance. In the second phase of analysis, all SNPs and haplotypes showing statistically significant association with diabetes status in the first phase were examined for association with glucose levels and other intermediate phenotypes in the quantitative trait (QT) study population. The intermediate phenotypes chosen for study were fasting and 2-h post-glucose load plasma glucose levels (measures of glucose tolerance), fasting insulin (a measure of insulin sensitivity), 30-min insulin incremental response (a measure of &#x003b2;-cell function), and body mass index (BMI) (a measure of adiposity). <italic/>
</p><p>Power to detect an association is dependent on several factors: the frequency of the &#x02018;predisposing' allele, genotype, or haplotype; the accepted false-positive or Type 1 error rate (&#x003b1;); and the odds ratio (OR) or effect size. Rarer alleles, genotypes, or haplotypes with small effects require larger sample sizes to attain the same power to detect an association, as compared to more frequent alleles or alleles with larger effects. At the time that we collected the populations and designed this study, our power calculations had shown that a sample size of 500 cases and 500 matched controls would have 80% power to detected effect sizes as small as 1.3&#x02013;1.7 OR, depending on the frequency of the predisposing allele, with a 5% Type 1 error rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0000020-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-0000020-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Power Calculations</title><p>Power of the current Cambridgeshire Case-Control Study to detect associations with risk allele of varying frequencies and with a Type 1 error rate of 5%.

In our study we replicated the effect of the E23K polymorphism in Type 2 diabetes predisposition (KK homozygous, OR 1.49, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0333; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0000020-t002">Table 2</xref>) with an OR estimate in agreement with that demonstrated by the meta-analysis of <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al.

Given our finding of high levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNP74 and SNP76 with E23K (data not shown), we adjusted the measures of association at these sites for the E23K genotype.

In our study we found evidence for association with Type 2 diabetes in five of 16 <italic>ABCC8</italic> SNPs tested. Owing to the physical mapping of <italic>ABCC8</italic> in close proximity to <italic>KCNJ11</italic>, we further investigated whether the associations at the <italic>ABCC8</italic> locus could be completely explained through LD between <italic>ABCC8</italic> SNPs and the E23K variant at <italic>KCNJ11</italic>. After adjustment for E23K, two <italic>ABCC8</italic> SNPs (SNP79 and SNP81) that were significantly associated with diabetes (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0043 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0048 for the recessive model; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0000020-t002">Table 2</xref>) prior to adjustment were no longer significantly associated with diabetes (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0536 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.1339 for the recessive model; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0000020-t004">Table 4</xref>). However, for the remaining three SNPs (SNP84, SNP87, and SNP89), although the significance levels were reduced, they remained statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0401, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0214, and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0445 for the recessive model; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0000020-t004">Table 4</xref>). Moreover, the OR for two of these SNPs increased to 4.36 and 3.16, respectively.

<italic>SLC2A2</italic> encodes the glucose transporter GLUT2, a member of the facilitative glucose transporter family that is highly expressed in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells and liver. We typed six SNPs in <italic>SLC2A2</italic>, three of which (SNP21, SNP23, and SNP24)<bold/>were significantly associated with diabetes status with an OR of approximately 1.4&#x02013;1.5 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0000020-t002">Table 2</xref>). The most highly significant association was with a T110I substitution (OR 1.49, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0059) under a dominant model for the minor allele. In the reduction process prior to haplotype estimations (see Materials and Methods), only one SNP (SNP21) contributed significantly to disease association. Therefore, haplotype reconstructions were not performed. In the QT study, all three disease-associated SNPs were also associated with lower levels of fasting plasma insulin. Rather surprisingly allele 2 (A) at T198, which was associated with increased disease risk, was associated with lower 2-h plasma glucose. No other significant associations with intermediate phenotypes were seen. <bold/>
</p><p>Multiple previous studies have sought evidence for association or linkage between <italic>SLC2A2</italic> variants and Type 2 diabetes, and most have reported negative results. However, all studies have been small and were insufficiently powered to detect effects of modest size (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Li1" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 1991</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Baroni1" ref-type="bibr">Baroni et al. 1992</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Tanizawa1" ref-type="bibr">Tanizawa et al. 1994</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Moller2" ref-type="bibr">Moller et al. 2001</xref>). <italic>SLC2A2</italic> is a highly plausible candidate gene for Type 2 diabetes, as it is a high K<sub>m</sub> transporter that regulates entry of glucose into the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell, thus initiating the cascade of events leading to insulin secretion. GLUT2 is also highly expressed in the liver, where it is involved in the regulation of both glucose uptake and output. It is notable that the alleles that associated with increased diabetes risk were also all associated with lower fasting insulin levels, suggesting that these may influence basal insulin secretion. However, interpretation is complex, as (1) fasting insulin is strongly influenced by insulin sensitivity and (2) the potential risk alleles were not associated with any impairment of insulin secretion in response to a glucose load. Finally, allele 2 (A) at T198, which associated with increased risk of diabetes in the case-control study, was associated with <bold>lower</bold> 2-h glucose in the QT study. Clearly, more detailed genetic mapping combined with functional studies (which will be challenging in humans owing to the inaccessibility of the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell) will be needed to identify the mechanism whereby variants in this gene influence diabetes risk.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>

While no individual SNP in <italic>HNF4A</italic> was significantly associated with disease status, we identified a haplotype (haplotype B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0000020-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) that was significantly associated with reduced disease risk (OR 0.83, 95% CI [0.68, 1.00]; data not shown). In the QT study, this &#x02018;reduced-risk' haplotype was<bold/>significantly associated with increased insulin secretion (mean = 31.5 pmol/mmol, 95% CI [29.9, 33.3] versus 29.3 pmol/mmol, 95% CI [28.0, 30.6] for haplotype A and 30.9 pmol/mmol, 95% CI [28.1, 34.0] for haplotype C]. Carriers of this haplotype also showed a trend towards lower fasting and 2-h plasma glucose, compared to the subjects with the other haplotypes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0000020-t003">Table 3</xref>). <italic>HNF4A</italic> maps to Chromosome 20 (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Argyrokastritis1" ref-type="bibr">Argyrokastritis et al. 1997</xref>) in a region that has been linked to Type 2 diabetes in multiple studies (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Bowden1" ref-type="bibr">Bowden et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Ji1" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Zouali1" ref-type="bibr">Zouali et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Ghosh1" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Klupa1" ref-type="bibr">Klupa et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Permutt1" ref-type="bibr">Permutt et al. 2001</xref>). This positional information, combined with the known role of major mutations at this gene in the causation of autosomal-dominant maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), has led to <italic>HNF4A</italic> being considered as a strong candidate for involvement in Type 2 diabetes.

Our findings lead us to speculate as to how a particular <italic>HNF4A</italic> haplotype might be associated with lower risk of diabetes and increased insulin secretory capacity. The fact that a multiplicity of heterozygous nonsense and missense mutations in HNF4&#x003b1; lead to an insulinopaenic form of MODY strongly suggests that &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction is sensitive to the amount of HNF4&#x003b1; in the &#x003b2;-cell and that haploinsufficiency is the likely mode of molecular pathogenesis in that condition (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Stoffel1" ref-type="bibr">Stoffel and Duncan 1997</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0000020-Shih1" ref-type="bibr">Shih et al. 2000</xref>).

Obesity is a major risk factor for insulin resistance, and the observed increase in BMI coupled with increased insulin resistance in carriers of allele G at SNP42 suggests that variation at this gene may be increasing Type 2 diabetes risk through impaired insulin action.

Recent data have shown that the peptide PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> encoded by this gene inhibits food intake and reduces weight gain when injected in rats, while physiological infusions of PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36 </sub>in humans decreased food intake by 33% (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Batterham1" ref-type="bibr">Batterham et al. 2002</xref>).

By its very nature, any study of candidate genes, however large, is restricted in scope, and it is likely that other variants (namely in regulatory regions, which we did not cover) in the genes that we have considered, as well as ones that we have not, may exist and have effects equal to or greater than those we have demonstrated. In addition, this study is not intended to be an &#x02018;exclusion study,' as many issues that relate to coverage of any given gene, environmental risk factors, and power in our populations do not allow us to definitively assert that negative findings correspond to genes that truly do not play a role in Type 2 diabetes predisposition.</p><p>The power of our study to detect small effects in uncommon variants was low. Evidence from many recent studies now suggests that in Type 2 diabetes the effects are likely in the range of OR 1.15&#x02013;1.5. It is clear that much larger studies than that reported here are required for such effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0000020-g004">Figure 4</xref>), in particular when adjusting to a lower Type 1 error rate of 0.01% to compensate for multiple testing. The significance of the associations we report have been described without adjustment for the number of tests undertaken, and thus the group of positive associations is likely to contain a proportion that is falsely positive. There is no consensus about the ideal method for adjusting the probability of an observation occurring by chance for multiple testing. The simple Bonferroni correction would constitute overadjustment because the 152 genetic markers in this study are not independent. In addition, in the false-discovery rate method (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Benjamini1" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg 1995</xref>), it is assumed that all N tests are carried out simultaneously, which may not correspond to reality if groups genotype one set of SNPs, as in this study, but then report results for additional SNPs at a later date. It is not clear whether the number of tests N should reflect the number to date or the number one might potentially undertake by continuing working through projects like these. An alternative Bayesian approach leading to a &#x02018;genome-wide&#x02019; significance level for association, such as has been done for whole-genome linkage studies (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Lander1" ref-type="bibr">Lander and Kruglyak 1995</xref>), might be preferable. However, this also runs into difficulties. In studies that are not based on fine-mapping of linkage intervals, but rather on candidate genes selected on the basis of data from other studies, including previous reports of association, it is unclear what level of prior probability of association should be used. As a result of this uncertainty about the appropriate method of correction for multiple testing, our preferred strategy is to report the number of tests done and to encourage readers to interpret the significance tests in that light, acknowledging that the results will require replication in other cohorts.</p><fig id="pbio-0000020-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Size of Case-Control Study Required to Detect Small Risk Effects</title><p>The number is shown of the case chromosomes (assuming an equal number of control chromosomes) required to attain 80% power to detect associations with the OR varying between 1.0 and 1.5 and with a Type 1 error rate of 0.01%.

This provides different information to a replication case-control study, as it may identify pathophysiological mechanisms by which the association with diabetes arises. We are cautious about putting forward particular variants as established &#x02018;diabetogenes' and enthusiastically invite researchers to examine these candidate variants in their own particular populations. Indeed, as the genetic architecture of Type 2 diabetes may vary between populations, it is critical that such variants are examined in multiple diverse ethnic groups. As with the Pro12Ala <italic>PPARG</italic> example, it is likely that meta-analysis of several studies will be required to narrow the CIs around the point estimates of association seen in any single study. This will be especially important when the association is weak, as it is for Pro12Ala, because few individual case-control studies, including the one reported here, are currently powered to detect very small increases in risk. It is, however, important that such meta-analyses include all studies of variants examined, rather than only those that are individually published, to avoid publication bias.</p><p>The associations we describe are highly biologically plausible and in many of the genes are supported by associations with multiple SNPs at the same locus. These include genes affecting both insulin secretion and insulin action. Given the importance of both insulin resistance and defective &#x003b2;-cell function to the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes, it is intriguing that we have found a disproportionate representation of genes affecting pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function among those that were found to be associated with diabetes risk. This contrasts with the impact of known environmental factors and their correlates (e.g., high-fat diet, lower physical activity, obesity, and central fat distribution), all of which are thought to have their major influence on diabetes risk through impairment of insulin action. While it would be premature to put forward any definitive model for the causation of Type 2 diabetes, it is tempting to speculate that the &#x02018;insulin resistance' component of the disease may have a substantial environmental influence modulated by polygenic effects, some of which may relate to molecules identified in this and other studies. On the other hand, the ability of the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell to continue to secrete sufficient insulin to maintain life-long normoglycaemia may be more profoundly influenced by genetic factors, some of which are reported herein. It will be critical to examine the functional consequences of such variants, a task that will be particularly challenging when it comes to genes influencing human &#x003b2;-cell function, as it is entirely possible that this disproportionate representation of &#x003b2;-cell genes may be a reflection of our success in choosing diabetes genes in each of the candidate genes in the major groupings.</p><p>The success of the approach presented here, although necessarily limited in scope, suggests that the<bold/>systematic examination of panels of biological candidate genes in large, well-characterised populations may usefully complement positional approaches to the identification of allelic variants conferring susceptibility to complex polygenic disease. The detection of multiple small gene effects accentuates the need for larger populations in order to reliably identify the types of effects (OR 1.15&#x02013;1.5) we now expect for complex diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Methods for SNP discovery and SNP selection for genotyping.</title><p>SNP discovery was performed by a high-fSSCP-based analysis, as previously described (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Thorpe1" ref-type="bibr">Thorpe et al. 1999</xref>).

To detect common variants, genes were screened against one or more of a variety of different DNA panels, which included a 47-member multiethnic human diversity panel (comprised of 17 Europid, seven Hispanic, 13 East Asian, and ten African-American subjects), our 129-member severe insulin-resistant cohort (<xref rid="pbio-0000020-Barroso1" ref-type="bibr">Barroso et al. 1999</xref>), a panel of 47 European-American samples, a panel of 47 African-American samples, and in some cases a panel of 94 samples (half European and half Asian Indian). Some genes had only partially screened coding sequence and splice junctions at the time of SNP selection for genotyping. In addition, we had access to an internal database of in silico SNPs that had been validated against 100 samples. Choice of polymorphisms for further testing in association studies was not constrained by the type of variant (e.g., nonsynonymous, silent, noncoding), although higher priority was given to variants with a likely effect on protein structure and function. Polymorphisms with a minor allele frequency greater than or equal to 5% were selected for further testing in population-based studies. In some instances, polymorphisms of lower allele frequency were genotyped to examine whether lower frequency variants with high penetrance might account for some cases of polygenic disease.

The PEP protocol was specifically developed and tested to ensure that allele bias was not introduced during the amplification process. A minimum of 12% internal replicate samples within each population (case control and QT) were included in all genotyping tests to assess genotyping accuracy. Only assays that provided 100% concordance between replicates were analysed for association. The genotyping pass rate was greater than 90% once a working assay had been established.
